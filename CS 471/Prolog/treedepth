% Input: A binary tree typed as a nested list
% Output: The longest path from root to leaf
% Precondition: The user provides a valid binary tree as a nested list
% Postcondition: The program will output the longest path from root to leaf

% The depth of nil is 0
mydepth(nil, 0).

% The depth of an atom is 0
mydepth(X, 0) :- atomic(X).

% mydepth of a nested list is max(depth(L),depth(R)) + 1
% L represents the left node, R represents the right node
% D returns the max depth of the left and right nodes + 1
mydepth([L | R], D) :- mydepth(L, D1), mydepth(R, D2), D is max(D1, D2) + 1.
