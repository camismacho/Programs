For our original platformer game, I shared a 25% workload with my groupmates for just about everything.
We didn't do too much with the game, because as time went on we realized the difficulty, and we didn't
get much done physically or documentation-wise for the game.

However, I came up with the idea for the new game. We used our Lightning Game from CS 477 and
built off of it. I made the entire Lighting Game myself, and then my group and I continued to build
on it for 371. As far development beyond the Lightning Game, I've written about 70% of the scripts 
for the game, and created some prefabs in Unity to make level creation easier. The menus ,in-game 
buttons, and Industrial levels are entirely my design.

As far as documentation for the new game, I wrote 80% of the Functionality Schedule. I helped write 
about 30% of the Requirements Specification, and wrote 50% of the User Stories. I was also responsible
for the GitHub repo and it's creation/organization.
