# Programs

Here you will find most of my work for my upper-division CS classes. Not all folders contain programs.
I will describe each directory below.

*Actual Programs*

1: CS 370

   This directory contains my compiler project, and is by far the largest program I have written. This compiler
   is written with Lex and Yacc. It can take some simple C concepts (local/global variables, assignments, print, if else,
   loops, syntax) and produce executable x86 Assembly. 
   
   To build and run it, navigate to "Compiler 7" and use the Makefile. The other folders contain previous iterations.
   
   Making will build and execute the Assembly and display the results in the terminal window. Typing "make assembly" will make
   as normal plus display the Assembly file at the end. "make rundebug" will run a debugger I implemented that will display
   a tree, which will allow you to track down syntax and see exactly what goes to what.
   
   I'm very proud of this compiler. It was a difficult but rewarding project.
   
2: CS 371

   This directory contains my work for Software Development. It's the same as my 'Program1' repo plus a few additional assignments.

*Written assignments and other fluff*

3: CS 419 / CS 475 / CS 477 / CS 482 / UNIV 110

   These folders don't contain any actual programming assignments. They mainly have written assignments and presentations I needed
   for these classes. They also have textbooks and assignment instructions. Used mainly when I jump from lab computers to my PC
   or laptop.
